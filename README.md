# Police Substation System

Law enforcement agencies are required to maintain accurate and comprehensive records
for legal purposes. Storing records in files allows for easier retrieval and analysis of information. While the police substation system focuses on improving service delivery
and community engagement, storing records in files supports effective information
management. The project aims to create a Police Substation System, which will
collect information about officers and their details. Officers are assigned to each
Substation. The goal of this project is to offer a complete description of the many
substations located throughout the geographical area, as well as information about the
officer assigned to that substation. File-based systems are often highly portable, as
files can be easily transferred between different systems or platforms. This portability
enables data sharing and interoperability between different applications and environments. The police substation system involves the establishment of smaller substations
strategically located within a jurisdiction to decentralize police operations and bring
law enforcement closer to the communities they serve. These substations act as an
extension of the main police headquarters, providing a physical presence in various
neighborhoods and promoting a proactive approach to policing. To identify the position of a record in a file, the Police Substation System will use the concept of Relative
Record Number.


## Application Modules
#### Substation Module
The substation module represents the various police stations across the geographical
area. These substations act as an extension of the main police headquarters, providing
a physical presence in various neighborhoods and promoting a proactive approach to
policing. These substations are strategically located to ensure a strong and visible
police presence in different neighborhoods, promoting community engagement and
fostering a sense of security among residents. Additionally, the substation module
serves as a repository for storing the details of officers assigned to each police station.
#### Officer Module
The Officer module serves as a crucial component within the police system, responsible for storing and managing essential information about individual police officers.
This module typically includes fields such as the officer’s name, rank, age, date of
birth (DOB), officer ID, and the substation ID to which they are assigned. By storing
officers’ details, the Officer module provides a centralized and organized repository of
information that can be easily accessed and updated as needed. This allows for efficient management of personnel within the police force, ensuring accurate records and
facilitating various administrative processes. By consolidating officer-related information in a centralized module, the police system can streamline various administrative
tasks. This includes managing officer assignments, tracking personnel movements,
generating reports, and conducting performance evaluations. It also allows for efficient coordination between the Officer module and other modules or components
within the system, such as the Substation module.
